### ‚úÖ Accomplishments & Key Decisions

* **Objective 1:** *Brief description of what was achieved. For example: "Successfully debugged the data ingestion error in the RAG system."*
* **Decision:** *Note any key decisions made. For example: "Decided to convert all future .xls files to Markdown .txt before uploading."*
* **Code Created/Modified:** *List any new scripts or significant code changes. For example: "Created `convert_xls_files.py` to automate data cleaning."*

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Roadblocks

* **Issue:** *Describe any problems encountered. For example: "The `python` command was not being recognized correctly in the terminal, pointing to the MS Store version instead of the venv."*
* **Solution:** *Detail the fix. For example: "Bypassed the issue by using the full, absolute path to the venv's python executable: `C:\...\venv\Scripts\python.exe`."*

### üöÄ Next Steps

* **Immediate Goal:** *What is the very next thing on the to-do list? For example: "Test the RAG system with queries against the newly indexed Annual Benefit Reports."*
* **Future Goal:** *What is the larger objective we are working towards? For example: "Begin the process of deploying the Flask API to Google Cloud Run for a permanent URL."*
